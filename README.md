## 🎯 **Objective**
Automate the **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** process using **GitHub Actions**.  
Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automated workflow that installs dependencies, runs tests, builds the project, and can deploy it automatically.  

---

## ⚙️ **Workflow Overview**

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 🧩 1 | **Trigger Event** | Starts on every push to the `main` branch |
| 🧱 2 | **Set up Node.js** | Initializes Node.js environment |
| 📦 3 | **Install Dependencies** | Installs required npm packages |
| 🧪 4 | **Run Tests** | Executes project test cases |
| 🏗️ 5 | **Build Project** | Compiles and builds the project |
| ☁️ 6 | **(Optional) Deploy** | Deploys the build (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or AWS) |
